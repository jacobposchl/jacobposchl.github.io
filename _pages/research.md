### Current Focus: A Symbolic-AI Model of Human Cognition

This research explores a hybrid AI architecture inspired by Carl Jung's model of the psyche and Karl Friston's free energy principle. The system is structured into three interdependent components:

*Conscious*: a reinforcement learning-like system that interacts with the environment in real time

*Subconscious*: a slower-adapting layer that encodes long-term memory, identity, and value structures

*Archetype*: a symbolic rule-based system that enforces hard constraints for interpretability and alignment.

The goal of this architecture is to bridge the gap between statistical learning and meaningful cognition by introducing subjective interpretation into AI. Rather than viewing "error" as a purely mechanical signal, this model treats meaning as emerging from prediction failures filtered through the subconscious. It offers a framework for building AI systems that are not only effective but also psychologically grounded, ethically interpretable, and capable of modeling human-relevant understanding.
