# Biomechanics Research

My biomechanics research focuses on understanding human movement patterns and developing AI systems that can analyze and provide feedback on athletic performance.

## Key Research Areas

### Motion Analysis
- Developing computer vision systems for real-time pose estimation
- Creating biomechanical models for different sports and activities
- Analyzing joint angles, velocities, and accelerations during athletic movements

### Performance Optimization
- Identifying optimal movement patterns for specific sports
- Developing personalized feedback systems based on individual body mechanics
- Creating adaptive training programs that evolve with athlete progress

### Applications in FormAI
This research directly informs the development of FormAI, which applies these biomechanical principles to provide real-time coaching feedback for athletes.

## Current Projects
- Basketball shooting form analysis
- Running gait optimization
- Weightlifting technique assessment
