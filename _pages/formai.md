# FormAI: Real-Time Biomechanical Feedback

**Mission**  
Empower athletes with instantaneous, data-driven form analytics.

**Problem**  
Most coaching tools rely on subjective observation; there’s no scalable way to deliver precise, real-time feedback on posture and movement.

**Solution & Differentiator**  
- **Hybrid AI Pipeline** – Combines state of the art pose estimation, temporal phase classification, and symbolic biomechanical rules for final validation.  
- **Biomechanical Insights** – Kinematic keypoints drive actionable suggestions (e.g., “Raise elbow 5°”).
