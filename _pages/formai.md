**The Next Wave of Human Performance**

**Our Mission**  
Revolutionize athletic training through intelligent, data-driven form analysis - making elite coaching accessible to everyone.

**The Problem**  
Athletes improve through repetition, but repetition alone is slow and uncertain without knowing whether each rep is correct. Traditional coaching offers guidance but is limited by cost, location, and availability. Many athletes never receive the personalized feedback they need to break through.

**Our Solution**  
We deliver a personalized, better-than-human coaching system powered entirely by your phone. Using cutting-edge AI, our system analyzes your form in real time, extracts biomechanical key features, and provides precise, actionable feedback tailored to your unique body and technique.

**Why We’re Different**

*Hybrid AI Pipeline* - Our architecture fuses pose estimation, temporal phase classification, and biomechanical rule validation to create a robust analysis pipeline. It runs on a fully containerized, cloud-native system for scalability and reproducibility.

*Biomechanical Precision* - Every frame is analyzed using skeletal keypoints, velocity, and joint angles. You receive suggestions like “Raise elbow by 5°,” based on validated kinematic heuristics and your own shooting history.

*Personalized Coaching Engine* - Gesture-based labeling (thumbs up) lets our LSTM model learn your definition of “good” form. Over time, the system builds a memory of your best shots to deliver hyper-customized feedback.
