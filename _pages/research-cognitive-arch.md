# Cognitive Architectures Research

My work on cognitive architectures focuses on developing computational models that mimic human cognitive processes and can be applied to create more intuitive and human-like AI systems.

## Research Focus

### Hybrid Cognitive Systems
- Combining symbolic and neural approaches to AI
- Developing systems with both rule-based reasoning and statistical learning
- Creating architectures that can explain their decision-making processes

### Memory and Learning Models
- Implementing multi-level memory systems (working, episodic, semantic)
- Modeling the interaction between fast and slow learning processes
- Developing systems that can form abstractions from concrete experiences

### Attention and Consciousness
- Creating computational models of attention allocation
- Implementing systems with both conscious and unconscious processing
- Exploring the role of attention in learning and decision-making

## Applications
This research has applications in creating AI systems that:
- Can reason about novel situations using prior knowledge
- Provide transparent explanations for their decisions
- Adapt to user preferences and needs in intuitive ways
- Exhibit more human-like learning curves and generalization abilities
