# Jungian AI System

This research explores a hybrid AI architecture inspired by Carl Jung's model of the psyche and Karl Friston's free energy principle. The system is structured into three interdependent components:

## System Architecture

*Conscious*: a reinforcement learning-like system that interacts with the environment in real time

*Subconscious*: a slower-adapting layer that encodes long-term memory, identity, and value structures

*Archetype*: a symbolic rule-based system that enforces hard constraints for interpretability and alignment.

## Goals and Applications

The goal of this architecture is to bridge the gap between statistical learning and meaningful cognition by introducing subjective interpretation into AI. Rather than viewing "error" as a purely mechanical signal, this model treats meaning as emerging from prediction failures filtered through the subconscious. It offers a framework for building AI systems that are not only effective but also psychologically grounded, ethically interpretable, and capable of modeling human-relevant understanding.

## Current Progress

- Developed initial theoretical framework
- Created prototype implementation of the three-layer architecture
- Testing on simple decision-making tasks
