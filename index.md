Iâ€™m Jacob Poschl, a computer science student at UC Santa Cruz and founder of FormAI.

My work bridges AI, neuroscience, and biomechanics, from hybrid cognitive architectures to real-time motion feedback for athletes.
I use this space to track my startup progress, research notes, and technical experiments.
