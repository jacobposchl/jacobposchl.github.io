Iâ€™m Jacob Poschl, a 3rd year CS major at UC Santa Cruz and founder of FormAI.

My interests bridge AI, neuroscience, and biomechanics. Currently I'm working on hybrid cognitive architectures to real-time motion feedback for athletes.
I use this space to track my startup progress, research notes, and technical experiments.
